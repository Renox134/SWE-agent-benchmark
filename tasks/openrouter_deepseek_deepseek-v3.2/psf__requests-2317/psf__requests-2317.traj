When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there.

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

Consider the following PR description:\n\n<pr_description>\nmethod = builtin_str(method) problem\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\n\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\nConverts method from\nb\u2019GET\u2019\nto\n\"b'GET\u2019\"\n\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method \"b'GET\u2019\u201d, it gets a 404 Not Found response.\n\nI am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this \"args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)\" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.\n\nAlso, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.\n\n\n</pr_description>\n\nCan you help me implement the necessary changes to the repository so that the requirements specified in the <pr_description> are met?\nI've already taken care of all changes to any of the test files described in the <pr_description>. This means you DON'T have to modify the testing logic or any of the tests in any way!\nYour task is to make the minimal changes to non-tests files in the /testbed directory to ensure the <pr_description> is satisfied.\nFollow these steps to resolve the issue:\n1. As a first step, it might be a good idea to find and read code relevant to the <pr_description>\n2. Create a script to reproduce the error and execute it with `python <filename.py>` using the bash tool, to confirm the error\n3. Edit the sourcecode of the repo to resolve the issue\n4. Rerun your reproduce script and confirm that the error is fixed!\n5. Think about edgecases and make sure your fix handles them as well\nYour thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long."

The `new_str` will be inserted AFTER the line `insert_line` of `path`.\\n    - view_range (array) [optional]: Optional parameter of `view` command when `path` points to a file. If none is given, the full file is shown. If provided, the file will be shown in the indicated line number range, e.g. [11, 12] will show lines 11 and 12. Indexing at 1 to start. Setting `[start_line, -1]` shows all lines from `start_line` to the end of the file.\\n\\nsubmit:\\n  docstring: submits the current file\\n  signature: submit\\n\\n\",\"multi_line_command_endings\":{},\"submit_command_end_name\":null,\"reset_commands\":[],\"execution_timeout\":30,\"install_timeout\":300,\"total_execution_timeout\":1800,\"max_consecutive_execution_timeouts\":3},\"history_processors\":[{\"type\":\"cache_control\",\"last_n_messages\":2,\"last_n_messages_offset\":0,\"tagged_roles\":[\"user\",\"tool\"]}],\"model\":{\"name\":\"openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-v3.2\",\"per_instance_cost_limit\":2.0,\"total_cost_limit\":0.0,\"per_instance_call_limit\":0,\"temperature\":0.0,\"top_p\":1.0,\"api_base\":null,\"api_version\":null,\"api_key\":null,\"stop\":[],\"completion_kwargs\":{},\"convert_system_to_user\":false,\"retry\":{\"retries\":20,\"min_wait\":10.0,\"max_wait\":120.0},\"delay\":0.0,\"fallbacks\":[],\"choose_api_key_by_thread\":true,\"max_input_tokens\":null,\"max_output_tokens\":null,\"litellm_model_registry\":null,\"custom_tokenizer\":null},\"max_requeries\":3,\"action_sampler\":null,\"type\":\"default\"},\"problem_statement\":{\"text\":\"method = builtin_str(method) problem\\nIn requests/sessions.py is a command:\\n\\nmethod = builtin_str(method)\\nConverts method from\\nb\u2019GET\u2019\\nto\\n\\\"b'GET\u2019\\\"\\n\\nWhich is the literal string, no longer a binary string.
